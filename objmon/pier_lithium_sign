    ** Experience Points **

Newbie starting out? Can't quite figure 
out how to rack up quick experience? 
Perhaps you're just a few 1000 xp shy of a 
level and you need a shark party? Well we
can help. Our staff of professional
adventurers can see to it that you rack up 
those xp! We GUARANTEE you will NOT die 
(barring computer lag) or you get a complete 
refund! We can even outfit you with rental 
equipment. Our price is a percentage of the 
booty the party gets from adventuring. We 
will even throw in a parting gift for you as
a souvenir of your stay! Other terms will be 
worked out between you and your PERSONAL 
adventuring party.

    Note: You MUST FOLLOW your party's 
    instructions, and the party chooses
    the location.

  	   ** Loan services **

You need credit? We can give it to you! Ran 
out of money for a much needed hazy? Need 
money for a crucial level? Come to us! We will 
lend you money (with interest). However, you 
must have collateral!
(We can make some exceptions...talk to us)

  ** Stress relief for chaotic characters **

We know that sometimes, chaotic characters
really want to try killing other chaotic
characters. Only few have ever dared to 
disrupt other players on Mordor. Hence, we at 
Pier Lithium offer chaotic characters a chance 
to duel with another chaotic character (we hire 
him for the task).  The cost of this service 
is 2000 gold. The winner keeps any weapon 
dropped upon the death of the loser. (Weapons 
are random -- our gladiators may carry some 
good stuff!) We may also provide an arena for 
two chaotics who wish to settle their 
differences with such a duel. Inquire for 
more details!

	  ** Additional Services **

* Clerical Vigor service: 
  In the heat of battle, we realize that some
  adventurers may run out of MP or even time 
  for a vigor. So we at Pier Lithium offer the
  opportunity for you to rent a cleric for the
  sole purpose of casting vigor on you during
  combat. The price is a mere 1000 gold/monster.
  NOTE: Cleric will not participate in combat.

* Spell teaching:
  We can teach you all the teachable spells
  for a mere 500 gold.

* We have an assassin on staff...

* Weapon retrieval service:
  Our rate is negotiable: talk to us! Price is
  dependent on difficulty of monster. 

Pier Lithium Imports: We're here to serve YOU!
