			Welcome to Celduin

	You are in the Tree of Life, which is located in the city of 
Celduin.  Celduin is only one of the fine cities of Isengard, and you 
are encouraged to explore.  It is _highly_ recommended before you 
begin play that you familiarize yourself with the commands and policies 
of the Land of Isengard.  You can do this by typing 'help' and 'help policy'
from your command prompt. 
	If you wish to try out any of the commands in a relatively safe
environment, go to the tree branch.  If, after reading the help files, you
feel that you are ready to venture out into the Land of Isengard proceed
carefully down the tree and into the city of Celduin. 
	Thank you for joining us, and we hope that you will enjoy your 
stay in Isengard.

	You DMs,
	Darwin, Bahamut, Tesseract, and Alice
