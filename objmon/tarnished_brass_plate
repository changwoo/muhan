		THE ONLY SECOND HAND STORE IN OCEAN CREST

				our motto is

			"WE BUY JUNK.
				WE SELL QUALITY"


		Because we buy with no questions asked, we sell
		with no guarantees...  We will buy anything we
		can sell at a profit.  We also take items on
		consignment and accept trade-ins on weapons and
		armor.  We often have new and unused items in our
		inventory.  Please ask.

		We loan money at a very reasonable 20% per day
		interest rate.  And with a smile!

		Please hold children by the hand while shopping.

		This is a family owned business....

		Fantine, mother of Finesse, grandmother of Fin, and
		great grandmother of Finessa, the bastard daughter
		of Fin, established this shop in 1266.  You can
		trust us!
