This book contains information on how to obtain custom equipment.
NOTE: You must be at least level 7 to buy custom equipment.

	You may purchase custom equipment from any DM or Caretaker. The
equipment currently available ranges from weapons for any proficiency, 
to armor and clothing that you can wear on any part of your body.
	 These pieces of equipment are of top quality, and should last you
two to three times longer than 90% of the other equipment you can get
elsewhere. The weapons are more damaging than 90% of the other weapons,
and have been enchanted to +4 by a 35th level mage.  This enchantment 
is of such high quality that they are guaranteed to be shatter-proof.
In addition your equipment can be cursed to assure that it is not dropped 
should you be killed while using it.
	You can choose the name of any piece of equipment, as well as the 
description.  Be sure you have your choices made and the gold available 
before asking for it to be constructed.
