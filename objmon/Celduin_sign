			Welcome to Celduin

	You are in the Tree of Life, which is located in the city of 
Celduin.  Celduin is only one of the fine cities of here, and you 
are encouraged to explore.
	It is _highly_ recommended before you begin play that you
familiarize yourself with the commands and policies of the Land of
Isengard.  You can do this by typing 'help', 'welcome' and 'help policy' 
from your command prompt. 
	If, after reading the help files, you feel that you are ready to
venture out then proceed carefully down the tree and into the city of
Celduin. 
	Thank you for joining us, and we hope that you will enjoy your 
stay.

	Your DMs,
	Gandalf, Tesseract, Frodo, Elrond, Galadriel, Mordor, and Isengard
