	+++++++> HOW TO GET A MAP OF ISENGARD <+++++++
		 (or how to use anonymous ftp)

	This file will show you how to get the map for Isengard. The maps
are available in three different formats, including .bmp, .gif, and
PostScript.  Most viewers will view either .bmp or .gif, but you need to
make sure you have a graphics viewer that can view these types of files. 
If you need to find a viewer, try reading a news group devoted to binary
picture files.  They usually have a listing of archives of free viewers. 
The same procedure you will use to get the map (anonymous ftp) can be used
to get the viewer. 
	The other file type is PostScript and it will allow you to print 
out a map to a PostScript capable printer.

To get the map follow this script:
