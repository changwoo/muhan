Greetings warriors!

	These facilities are run by the Isengard militia.  In order for
you to receive authorization for their use, you must first join the
militia by visiting the main office in Celduin.  Colonel Arnor will be
able to help you in signing up to join the most elite fighting force in
Isengard, and be sure to ask him about the armory.
