battle
Yes, we fight a battle with the forces of the undead.  Tell me, what is your current level?
nine
You must free the spirit of a sailor that was murdered in the North Lookout Tower, near Lelion Beach.  I warn you though, it is very dangerous.
dangerous
Yes, many never make it past the ninth level of wisdom.  The sailors are very dangerous.  I strongly suggest you go alone.
alone
They will know you must be powerful, and thus only a few may come to investigate.  Bring me one of their lockets, and you may train to become a priest.
ten
Ahhhhh!  A priest already!  You must provide solace to a restless spirit.
restless
Yes, the spirit of a long dead adventurer now dwells beneath the barrow just east of Celduin.  Speak with him, and give him comfort. 
comfort
Yes, he requires the comfort in death that an individual who was once so renowned deserves.  Ask him about his woes, and return with his blessing.
eleven
You are now strong enough to help us with a quest that has plagued us for centuries.
quest ACTION cringe
Long ago, a cleric of good, Luxen, found himself in conflict with the temple of Romendacil.  The high priest, Temar, overcame Luxen and sealed his immortal soul in a crystalline cage.  It is in that cage that Luxen must spend his days in solitude.  Seek out Temar, and see if you can learn more of Luxen's fate.
