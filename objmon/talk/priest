Please add the following to the talk directory for The_High_Priestess-12:

battle
Yes, we fight a battle with the forces of the undead.  Tell me, what is 
your current level?
nine
You must free the spirit of a sailor that was murdered in the North 
Lookout Tower, near Lelion Beach.  I warn you though, it is very dangerous.
dangerous
Yes, many never make it past the ninth level of wisdom.  The sailors are 
very dangerous.  I strongly suggest you go alone.
alone
They will know you must be powerful, and thus only a few may come to 
investigate.  Bring me one of their lockets, and you may train to become 
a priest.
