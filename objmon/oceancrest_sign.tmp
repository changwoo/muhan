Welcome to Oceancrest

Please read this note occassionally to get up to the date information 
regarding scenario and other possible changes to the game.  

I will also post changes to the training centers here when they are
eventually built.  

***Last Update: 7 January 1992*** 

New Items:

  - Caledon's Guide to Oceancrest is available at the Nowhere Fast 
Traveller's Guild on Wakeforest Drive, north of Lelion Way.  This is
a new section of town, so some roads are incomplete and there are some
new places to explore.  Some of the bars in this section of town are rather
dangerous.

  - Quests have been implemented.  In order to start on a quest, travel
to the Red-Eye Pub off of Hofton Avenue and Lorian Parkway.  Talk to
characters by typing "talk <monster> <keyword>".  It is not suggested
that you start this quest until you are at least level 7.  It is intended
for individual players, but you will need help in order to defeat some
monsters.  Please do not share information about the quests unless it
is specifically asked for.  This way everyone can try out their problem
solving skills.  (ie.  don't tell people where to find Nathan, the Unicorn
because they should be able to find him on their own through talking with 
various people).  Start this adventure by talking to Aetelos at the Red-Eye
Pub in north Oceancrest.

  - New Training Locations for Mages and Clerics will be implemented soon.
The new locations are:

	Mages:
	Beginner (1-3):  Iilandi University Library
        Novice   (4-6):  Oceancrest Municiple Library
        Intermediate (7-9)
		      :  Keslar Palace
        Advanced (10+):  The Wizard's Eye

        Clerics:
        Beginner (1-3):  Temple of the Rising Moon
        Novice   (4-6):  Temple of Harmonic Discord
        Interm.  (7-9):  Shrine of Life and Death
        Advanced (10+):  Cathedral of Worldly Bliss

These will be implemented in the next few days.  Watch for the changes.

Please read this note before exploring the city.

There are a couple of dangerous places in town.  Please read the
LONG descriptions when exploring of the first time.  When the description
says "they might not like you here" or "there is a large bouncer standing
at the door" it probably isn't a good idea to go in there without a number
of people.  Similarly, "large, carniverous plants" is another tip off that
this place might be a little dangerous.  

A map of Oceancrest is available through anonymous ftp at ics.uci.edu
under the pub/bvickers/map.ps.  Note that this map does NOT list all the
buildings and locations in Oceancrest, but just lists the streets and 
their orientation to each other.  With this "road map", you should be
able to fill in the various shops and centers, and find quick ways to and 
from different parts of town.  Unfortunately, the map is not quite to
scale, and some of the southern streets appear a little close together.  
I suggest printing out the map and then making an enlarged copy of it
to write all your notes on.  I hope the map is benificial to your enjoyment
of Mordor.   


Training Centers:

Of course it will become necessary to train.  The following is a list of
permanent or temporary training centers for various classes.  Because the
town is not yet complete, some training centers will move.  All thieves'
and assassins guilds are hidden.

Thief:   The Swift Hand (Permanent) Beginners (1-2)
         The Invisible Hand (Perm/Temp)
            - all thieves level 3 or above will train here.  eventually,
              this will be only for novice thieves (3-5)

Assassin: The Silent Knife (Permanent) Beginners (1-2)
          The Rusty Dagger (Permanent) Novice (3-5)
          The Poisoned Dagger (Perm/Temp)
             - all assassins level 6 or above will train here.  eventually,
               this will be fore intermediate assassins only (6-8)

* All Warrior Classes (fighters, barbarians, paladins and rangers) must
"fight" an opponent one-on-one in order to advance to the next level.  The
opponent will be one level above your current level and will have the
exact same stats.  All the combat training locations haven't been completed
yet, so higher level warriors may not have to compete.

Barbarians:  All in the Barbarian Pits
Ranger:      All train in the Riverdell Center for Tracking Training
              - non-combattive as of yet

Paladin:     Holy Order of the White Rose (perm) Beginners (1-2)
             Shrine of Truth and Fairness (perm/temp)
              - will be for novice paladins, but now for all paladins
                level 3 or higher.

Fighter:     Panthor Academy of Fighting Arts (Permanent) Beginner (1-2)
             Rudolph's Fighting Academy (Permanent) Novice (3-5)
             Roland's Royal Fighting Academy (Perm/Temp)
              - eventually for intermediate fighters, but now for all
                fighters level 6 and above

Both of these are temporary training sites and will be moves as soon as
the rest of the town is completed.

If you have any questions, comments or suggestions about the town, please
send mail to Caledon at any of the post offices scattered about the town.
