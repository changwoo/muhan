Surprisingly, the envelope the papers are in appears to be open.  There is 
a note enclosed that reads...


Dear Dr. Jahred,
	We have received the terracotta scroll, and have sent it to our
miners in the mountains.  It will prove most useful in the further
extraction of the precious mithril that lies in the bowels of Saeros. 
	We have encountered one problem, however.  Our courier, Dorin, 
has not been heard from since his departure from Celduin several days 
ago.  I fear that he may have been delayed in the Northern Foothills by 
Grombor and his evil giant clan.  My brothers have assembled and are 
preparing to set an expedition to find Dorin and the scroll.
	Hopefully, I will have better news when we meet again.

	In the spirit of Moradin,
	Thoringil
