	======== NOTICE TO THE CITIZENS OF CELDUIN ========

	 Due to the large number of goblins in the area, 
	 the city gates will be closed at night until 
	 further notice.  If you need to leave town,
	 you may do so, but returning into Celduin is
	 restricted to the daytime hours. 

		Signed,
		Mayor Millwood
